### A Simple Calculator using JS OOP best practices

### How I Made It:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- I started by laying out the basic framework and simple styles with HTML and CSS. After I did some research and review on OOP. Whenever I got stuck in a part, I would look up similar projects to see how others solved problems that I was running into. Once I had all the JS working, I cleaned up the CSS to make everything more visually pleasing.

### Things I Learned:

- Choosing your class names correctly and applying them to the correct elements really saves you a lot of trouble in the long run.
- Classes and Ids really help make the JS process smoother and simpler because it allows you to apply the same function to mulptiple elements.
- Dividing up the program using OOP helps keep things organized, and allows isolated changes to be made.
